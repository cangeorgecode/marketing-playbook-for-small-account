# The Marketing Playbook for solopreneurs with a small follower count

This is the content strategy for solopreneurs who love to build but hate to create content for Instagram. 

&nbsp;

## Why Instagram?  

Because making video content is harder than making text-based content
- automatically generate reels with voiceover and text overlay
- and then automatically uploads to Instagram using the official API

## Product Idea - What to build?

I start with a goal in mind and whatever gets in the way of achieving it, I remove it. HOW I remove it becomes my product.  

Here's an example - I want to start an online business so I can work anywhere on my own schedule, but I hate creating content. It's tedious, time consuming and it takes a lot of effort coming up with content.  

I was inconsistent in my posting schedule and my content feels empty.  

My solution? I wrote some code to automate reels generation and upload. Now, I can effortlessly create reels.  

Think of a gigantic problem you have solved and most likely, many others are facing the same problem and that's your niche.

## Content creation - copywriting  

But why does it matter what you build?  

It matters a lot because if it is a painful problem you experienced first hand and you overcame it one way or another, that gives you SOOOO much conviction when it comes time to pitch it to your potential customer.  

THAT is where you draw inspiration from to write about it.  

But knowing only the pain is half the equation. Knowing how to frame it and present it to your audience needs a bit more skill.  

This is how I write for my content:-
1. Start with presenting the value - (dream outcome x perceived likelihood of success) / (time and effort). E.g., "This is how I create 10 pieces of reels without acutally filming for any content as a solopreneur in less than 30 minutes".
2. Talk about the problem, agitate it a bit, bring up the emotional trauma.
3. Then present your solution.
4. ALWAYS ALWAYS include a call to action

But isn't it exhausing trying to come up with what to talk about everyday?  

It is, but the truth is, you don't need 100 unqiue ideas to create content on. In fact, you just need 2 to 3 core ideas and then frame them differently.  

Here is what I mean.

Core content idea:- I am a self taught developer who wants to create multiple successful SaaS. I love building and creating SaaS but I don't particularly like or know how to do marketing to get people to use my apps.  

3 different ways to present my core idea:

1. Here's how I went from posting every few days to posting regularly without burning out as a developer
2. Did you know that you can create almost 100 pieces of content from just 2-3 core ideas?
3. If you love building SaaS but hate doing marketing, this is how I only spend 30 minutes a week on marketing and still get thousands of sign ups to my SaaS

The key is to list out the pain points you have experienced, which is why it is important to do something you are passionate about, so that when hard time comes, and it will come, you can keep going.

## Marketing - How to get clients even if you have a small follower count

I don't believe having a massive followers is a must. As you niche down, the number of potential client reduces, so naturally, you might only have a very small follower base.  

But that is your advantage because you don't need to worry about growing your account which can take some time, if done properly.  

So, what's the secret to converting a viewer to a customer? Just posting content alone is not enough.  

You need to be purposeful with your CTA and this is how:-

At the end of each piece of content, you always want to ask your viewer to comment. When they do, you send them a free guide in the DM. You wait a few days, give them something of value again. You wait a few more days and you finally make them an offer.  

That is called a marketing funnel. It goes from traffic -> values -> product awareness -> sale
