# The Marketing Playbook for Solopreneurs Who Hate Marketing  
I am a self-taught developer who struggled with marketing big time. 


## How I used to do marketing before

1. I tried to record myself everyday
2. Post daily (if I feel like it)
3. Burnt out and don't know what content I can talk about
4. Gave up after a few days

## How I do marketing now  

1. I write the scripts based on 2-3 pain points that I have experienced
2. I use my own program to create reels without filming even 1 second of content
3. My program automatically uploads to Instagram using the official API
4. My program doesn't complain and it doesn't burnout

### How I found my product idea after trying 100s of ideas, shipped 20 SaaS  
You don’t need to “find” ideas.  
You just decide the life you want, then every single thing that blocks you from that life becomes your product.

Example:  
I wanted to run an online business from anywhere, on my own schedule.  
The biggest block? I hate creating content. It’s boring, repetitive, and takes hours to film and edit.  
So I built a bot that creates and posts Reels for me, which becomes my product  

Your turn:  
Ask yourself – what kind of life do you really want?  
What is the ONE thing that keeps stopping you?  
Solve that for yourself first.  
That solution is your product.

### You only need 2–3 pain points forever (not 100 ideas)
I only talk about three pains that I personally experienced.  
I repeat them in every reel, just phrased differently.

My three pains (and yours probably too):
1. I find content creation boring, tedious, and repetitive — I can’t stick to it for more than a few days.
2. I can’t think of 100 new ideas — my brain goes blank after 5 posts.
3. Filming and editing takes hours — I would rather code or build apps.

That’s it. Three pains. Infinite content.

### Content matrix – mix and match (you never run out of ideas again)

| Hook (start of reel)                              | Pain point (middle)                                          | Solution & benefit (end)                                      | CTA (last 3 seconds)                  |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Did you know…                                     | …content creation is boring and I burn out in a week?         | I built a robot that makes reels while I sleep                 | Comment “GUIDE” for the free guide     |
| Have you ever noticed…                             | …you spend 5 hours filming one reel and still hate the result? | Now I spend 30 minutes a week and get better results           | Comment “ROBOT” and I’ll DM you      |
| This is how I went from…                          | …hating marketing and posting once a month                    | …to posting every day without touching my phone                  | Save this + comment “AUTOMATE”        |
| How I achieved [dream] even though [setback]       | …I’m a developer who would rather code than talk to camera     | Built a system that runs 100 % autonomously                     | Share this with a friend who hates IG  |

Just pick one from each column → you have a new reel.  
3 hooks × 3 pains × 3 solutions = dozens of reels from the same idea.

### The exact funnel I use (step-by-step for complete beginners)
1. You post a reel using the matrix above.
2. At the end you say:  
   “If you also hate creating content, comment the word GUIDE and I will send you my free playbook in DM.”
3. The second someone comments → my robot instantly sends them this exact guide you are reading right now.
4. 3–4 days later → I (or the robot) send a short extra tip (example: “here’s the google sheet I use to generate 100 hooks from 3 pains”).
5. 7–10 days after their comment → I send a soft offer:  
   “Want me to build the exact same robot for you so you never have to create content again? Reply YES and I’ll tell you the price.”

Cold traffic → value → value → warm lead → sale.

That’s the whole funnel.  
It works with 100 followers or 100,000 followers — only the speed changes.

## How I created an automatic lead generation machine
(that runs automatically on multiple accounts)

1. I take one simple picture (screenshot, meme, whatever).  
2. I write a short script myself (9–12 sentences) because AI still can’t copywrite like a human.
3. My program turns that one picture + script into a full, perfect Reel with voiceover, animated text, 1080×1920.
→ I have literally created 30+ Reels without filming even 1 second of video.

4. The same program automatically uploads one Reel every single day using the official Instagram Graph API (100 % compliant, zero ban risk).
5. The second someone comments → the robot instantly DMs them this exact guide you’re reading.

The program completely takes care of the content creation aspect, except the script writing part and that is something I am working on right now.  

So far, the program can pretty much handle the bulk of content creation, leaving me with more time to build.
