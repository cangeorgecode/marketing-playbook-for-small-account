# The Marketing Playbook for Solopreneurs who don't like or don't know how to do Marketing  
After launching 20 SaaS, made 3 sales and $87 in the last 2 years as a solopreneur, I realize something needs to change.  

I have never been consistent with marketing because it's time consuming and I burnt out trying to come up with content, filming and editing everyday. I would post for a few days and then disappear for months.   

That's when it hit me. What if I could automate content creation and posting? So I began building a lead generation machine that can run on its own.  

But this guide isn't about what I have built. My goal is to share what I know about lead generation with a small follower count on Instagram. 

I am going to touch on the following topics in this guide:  
- The marketing funnel that I am using to monetize my small Instagram account
- The content matrix that I use to come up with infinite content using just 2 to 3 pain points

## How I used to do marketing

1. I do a thing, record myself doing it, talk over the video, do a bit of editing, and then post it
2. I try to be consistent and do this everyday
3. I soon realized that I ran out of things to talk about and I was burning out
4. I gave up and disappeared

## How I do marketing now

I have created a program that can generate reels for me, add voiceover, add text overlay (not shown in the demo), and upload to my Instagram account and Story for me.  

It is still in development but theorectically, I can create content without doing any filming or editing. It can also scale to multiple accounts.  

At the moment, the script is still written manually by myself because I am not quite satisfied with what AI wrote for me. 


&nbsp;


## The exact funnel I use (step-by-step for complete beginners)
1. You post a reel that addresses a pain point and provide a solution (provide value)
2. At the end you ask people to reach out. These will become your warm leads. For example, “If you also hate creating content, comment the word GUIDE and I will send you my free playbook in DM.”
3. The second someone comments → you send them a free guide
4. 3–4 days later → you (or a bot) send a short extra tip (example: “here’s the google sheet I use to generate 100 hooks from 3 pains”).
5. 7–10 days after their comment → you send a soft offer: “Want me to build the exact same robot for you so you never have to create content again? Reply YES and I’ll tell you the price.”

Cold traffic → value → value → warm lead → sale.

## How I created an automatic lead generation machine
(that runs automatically on multiple accounts)

1. I take one simple picture (screenshot, meme, whatever).  
2. I write a short script myself (9–12 sentences) because AI still can’t copywrite like a human.
3. My program turns that one picture + script into a full, perfect Reel with voiceover, animated text, 1080×1920.
→ I have literally created 30+ Reels without filming even 1 second of video.

4. The same program automatically uploads one Reel every single day using the official Instagram API.
5. The second someone comments → the robot instantly DMs them this exact guide you’re reading.

The program completely takes care of the content creation aspect, except the script writing part and that is something I am working on right now.  

So far, the program can pretty much handle the bulk of content creation, leaving me with more time to build.

## Content matrix - How I come up with many content idea from just 2 to 3 pain points?
I only talk about three pains that I personally experienced.  
I repeat them in every reel, just phrased differently.

My three pains (and yours probably too):
1. Content creation is boring, tedious, and repetitive — I quickly burn out
2. I can’t think of 100 new ideas — my brain goes blank after 5 posts.
3. Filming and editing takes hours — I would rather code or build apps.

That’s it. Three pains. Infinite content.

### Content matrix – mix and match (you never run out of ideas again)

| Hook (start of reel)                              | Pain point (middle)                                          | Solution & benefit (end)                                      | CTA (last 3 seconds)                  |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Did you know…                                     | …content creation is boring and I burn out in a week?         | I built a robot that makes reels while I sleep                 | Comment “GUIDE” for the free guide     |
| Have you ever noticed…                             | …you spend 5 hours filming one reel and still hate the result? | Now I spend 30 minutes a week and get better results           | Comment “ROBOT” and I’ll DM you      |
| This is how I went from…                          | …hating marketing and posting once a month                    | …to posting every day without touching my phone                  | Save this + comment “AUTOMATE”        |
| How I achieved [dream] even though [setback]       | …I’m a developer who would rather code than talk to camera     | Built a system that runs 100 % autonomously                     | Share this with a friend who hates IG  |

Just pick one from each column → you have a new reel.  
3 hooks × 3 pains × 3 solutions = dozens of reels from the same idea.
