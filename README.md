# The Marketing Playbook for Solopreneurs Who Hate Marketing  
(works even if you have 200 followers)

This guide is for people who love building stuff but hate creating content and hate marketing even more.  
I am writing this with zero results to show yet.  
I have less than 300 followers right now and I have made $0 from Instagram so far.  
But the robot already runs every day without me touching anything.  
That’s the whole point of this guide.

### Why I picked Instagram (even though I hate it)
Among text, pictures, and video, short-form video is the hardest to create.  
It takes the most time, the most energy, and the most creativity.  
If I can automate the hardest thing, everything else becomes easy.  
That’s why I chose Instagram Reels.

### How to find your product idea (the beginner way)
You don’t need to “find” ideas.  
You just decide the life you want, then every single thing that blocks you from that life becomes your product.

Example:  
I wanted to run an online business from anywhere, on my own schedule.  
The biggest block? I hate creating content. It’s boring, repetitive, and takes hours to film and edit.  
So I built a robot that creates and posts Reels for me.  
That robot is now my product.

Your turn:  
Ask yourself – what kind of life do you really want?  
What is the ONE thing that keeps stopping you?  
Solve that for yourself first.  
That solution is your product.

### You only need 2–3 pain points forever (not 100 ideas)
I only talk about three pains that I personally experienced.  
I repeat them in every reel, just phrased differently.

My three pains (and yours probably too):
1. I find content creation boring, tedious, and repetitive — I can’t stick to it for more than a few days.
2. I can’t think of 100 new ideas — my brain goes blank after 5 posts.
3. Filming and editing takes hours — I would rather code or build apps.

That’s it. Three pains. Infinite content.

### Content matrix – mix and match (you never run out of ideas again)

| Hook (start of reel)                              | Pain point (middle)                                          | Solution & benefit (end)                                      | CTA (last 3 seconds)                  |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Did you know…                                     | …content creation is boring and I burn out in a week?         | I built a robot that makes reels while I sleep                 | Comment “GUIDE” for the free guide     |
| Have you ever noticed…                             | …you spend 5 hours filming one reel and still hate the result? | Now I spend 30 minutes a week and get better results           | Comment “ROBOT” and I’ll DM you      |
| This is how I went from…                          | …hating marketing and posting once a month                    | …to posting every day without touching my phone                  | Save this + comment “AUTOMATE”        |
| How I achieved [dream] even though [setback]       | …I’m a developer who would rather code than talk to camera     | Built a system that runs 100 % autonomously                     | Share this with a friend who hates IG  |

Just pick one from each column → you have a new reel.  
3 hooks × 3 pains × 3 solutions = dozens of reels from the same idea.

### The exact funnel I use (step-by-step for complete beginners)
1. You post a reel using the matrix above.
2. At the end you say:  
   “If you also hate creating content, comment the word GUIDE and I will send you my free playbook in DM.”
3. The second someone comments → my robot instantly sends them this exact guide you are reading right now.
4. 3–4 days later → I (or the robot) send a short extra tip (example: “here’s the google sheet I use to generate 100 hooks from 3 pains”).
5. 7–10 days after their comment → I send a soft offer:  
   “Want me to build the exact same robot for you so you never have to create content again? Reply YES and I’ll tell you the price.”

Cold traffic → value → value → warm lead → sale.

That’s the whole funnel.  
It works with 100 followers or 100,000 followers — only the speed changes.

The Robot I Actually Built (this is the part that makes people go “holy shit”)
Right now the whole system runs like this:

I take one simple picture (screenshot, meme, whatever).
I write a short script myself (9–12 sentences) because AI still can’t copywrite like a human.
My program turns that one picture + script into a full, perfect Reel with voiceover, animated text, background music, 1080×1920.
→ I have literally created 30+ Reels without filming even 1 second of video.
→ That’s the power of this thing.
The same program automatically uploads one Reel every single day using the official Instagram Graph API (100 % compliant, zero ban risk).
The second someone comments → the robot instantly DMs them this exact guide you’re reading.
Follow-up messages and offers go out automatically too.

I built this because I refused to become another “camera-face” creator.
Now the robot does the part I hate, and I just sit back and watch the DMs roll in.

### Current results (being 100 % honest)
- Followers right now: less than 300  
- Money made from Instagram: $0 (as of today)  
- Reels posted by robot so far: 50+  
- Comments received: growing every day  
- Leads in DM: growing every day

I am not “successful” yet.  
But the system runs without me.  
And every day it gets me one step closer.

### Final words
If you are a builder who hates marketing,  
stop trying to become a good marketer.  
Become the person who builds robots that do the marketing for you.

Then sell those robots to everyone else who hates it too.

Keep shipping.  
Keep being honest.  
The money will come — it just takes longer than the gurus say.

This guide will be updated every time I learn something new or when I finally close my first $10k client from this funnel.
