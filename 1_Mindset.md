# Mindset – stop thinking you need money to make money  

I have seen so many posts on Reddit where people are asking, "I have got X amount of money, what business should I start?"  

I can tell you, you can start most online businesses with less than $500.

## But, why bother?

Most of us need a second job just to survive in this economy, but what if we could start an online business, work anywhere, wake up at anytime, wouldn't that be great?

My parents lied to me, telling me a 9 to 5 is safe. But look at what happened in 2025! Mass layoffs. Those who have a job can't even afford a house. What even is the point?   

I am not trying to be pessimistic and all, but a 9 to 5 is never for me. I started building while I still had a job. It took a long time to figure out what I want to do, to learn the technical skills, to learn copywriting (which is basically sales in writing) and marketing.  

I am sharing the sales and marketing bit here for my fellow solopreneurs, because I know how much you don't like doing it ;)
