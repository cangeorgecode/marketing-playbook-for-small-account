# Mindset – stop thinking you need money to make money  

I have seen so many posts on Reddit where people are asking, "I have got X amount of money, what business should I start?"  

I can tell you, you can start most online businesses with less than $500.

## But, why bother?

Most of us need a second job just to survive in this economy, but what if we could start an online business, work anywhere, wake up at anytime, wouldn't that be great?

My parents lied to me, telling me a 9 to 5 is safe. But look at what happened in 2025! Mass layoffs. Those who have a job can't even afford a house. What even is the point?   

I am not trying to be pessimistic and all, but a 9 to 5 is never for me. I started building while I still had a job. It took a long time to figure out what I want to do, to learn the technical skills, to learn copywriting (which is basically sales in writing) and marketing.  

I am sharing the sales and marketing bit here for my fellow solopreneurs, because I know how much you don't like doing it ;)

# Product Idea - What are you actually going to sell?

Everyone on the internet is telling me to "solve your own problem", "follow your passion". Well, I have many problems - I don't like working a 9 to 5, I have a family and we don't get paid enough. I am also passionate about many things - powerlifting, anything tech-related.   

But all of that is so vague and it doesn't tell me what I can sell.  

Maybe I am being dramatic here, but I want to make money doing the things that I enjoy doing. If I want to make money and be miserable, I can always look for another job.  

## How I finally found the product I can sell?

I first imagined what my dream life looks like - I want to work anywhere, work for myself, work on my own schedule so I can spend time with my family.
